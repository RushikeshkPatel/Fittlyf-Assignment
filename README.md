ðŸ“Š Global Unemployment Analysis Dashboard (Python & Matplotlib/Seaborn)

ðŸ”Ž Project Overview
This project presents a Global Unemployment Analysis for the years 1991-2021. The analysis focuses on visualizing trends, identifying countries with high unemployment, and deriving actionable insights. It is designed to help policymakers, researchers, and analysts quickly understand unemployment patterns globally.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Sample global unemployment dataset (for analysis purposes)
Fields Included: Country, Year, Unemployment

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights from the Analysis
- **Top Countries with Highest Unemployment:** Identified based on cumulative unemployment over 30 years
- **Trends Over Time:** Some countries show consistent decreases, while others have persistent high unemployment
- **Regional Patterns:** Certain regions show higher unemployment consistently, highlighting economic and social disparities

Breakdown of Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Missing values handled using linear interpolation
   - Data aggregated by country for trend analysis
2. **Visualization**
   - Trends plotted for top 5 countries
   - Comparison across countries and years to identify patterns
3. **Summary Statistics**
   - Total unemployment per country
   - Yearly averages and growth rates

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Python â†’ Data analysis, aggregation, and visualization
- Pandas â†’ Data cleaning and manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn â†’ Line plots and trend visualization
- CSV/Excel â†’ Raw dataset preparation and storage

ðŸš€ Outcomes
- Cleaned and structured unemployment dataset
- Identified countries and years with highest unemployment rates
- Visualized trends to support policy and economic decision-making
- Generated actionable insights for global unemployment research


ðŸ“„ Conclusion
- **Trends Over Time:** Unemployment rates vary widely across countries due to economic and social factors
- **Actionable Insights:** Focused interventions can be designed for regions with high unemployment
- **Future Work:** Incorporate GDP, labor force participation, and interactive dashboards for predictive modeling
